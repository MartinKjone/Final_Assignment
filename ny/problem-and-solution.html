          <p>Food is a finite resource many Norwegians take for granted. Norwegians are amongst the most wasteful of
            people and hence contribute to the food shortage starving many around the globe.</p>

      <div id="conclusion">
        <p>In conclusion, on average a Norwegian citizen wastes 42,5 kg of edible food every year. This 58% wastage
          could feed half a million people and reduce world hunger.</p>

          <h1>Our solution.</h1>
          <p>Our solution aims to reduce the wastage of food by introducing an accessible and easy-to-use app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block float-right">
          <img class="float-right" alt="Sustainable Development Goal 2" src="assets/sdg-2-2.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content clear">
        <div class="block float-right icon-center">

        </div>

        <div class="block float-left">
          <p>There are many reasons to wastage of food but seeing as 20% of it comes from dinner leftovers, we believe
            one of the major factors are laziness and lack of accessible information. Therefore, have we prioritized the
            ease of use of the app and the amount of time it takes to use.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content clear">
        <div class="block float-left icon-center">
          <img alt="Clock icon" src="assets/info.svg" width="150px">
        </div>

        <div class="block float-right">
          <p>The main functionality of the app is to inform how leftovers from meals inputted by the user can be used,
            be it used in another dish or donated. The secondary function of the app is to be an accessible and correct
            informed library of information regarding food. The information on the app is as an example how long cooked
            food and leftovers can safely be stored and what the optimal storage condition is. The app will also contain
            information about how long after a product has gone past its “best before” date it is safe to consume and
            dispelling of general misconceptions such as food intolerance being the same as food allergy while they’re
            not.</p>

      <div class="content clear">
        <div class="block float-right icon-center">
          <img alt="Clock icon" src="assets/health.svg" width="150px">
        </div>

        <div class="block float-left">
          <p>The app can also be personalized by inputting age, weight, height and fitness. Personalization is not
            necessary to use the app nor will it be advertised, so as that the app does not become intrusive towards the
            user. If personalized the app can then help plan healthy meals and by also inputting your meals throughout
            the week, help find vitamins and nutrients you are lacking in your diet.</p>

          <img alt="Clock icon" src="assets/donate.svg" width="150px">
        </div>

        <div class="block float-right">
          <p>As earlier stated, the app helps with deciding what to do with leftovers, one option being donation. By
            deciding to donate, the donation will be uploaded to our network so that other users of the app can see it
            and decide whether they wish to partake in the donation.</p>
