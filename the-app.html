      Our app can be personalized by inputting age, weight, height and fitness. 
      It will then help plan healthy meals and by also inputting your meals throughout the week and 
      help find vitamins and nutrients you are lacking in your diet.
      <br>  
      The app also works to share leftovers. By deciding to donate your leftovers rather than using 
      them yourself or throwing it away, other users of the app can come to you and receive the donation.
